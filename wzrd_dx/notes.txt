Now that I understand the book app better, implement it my way.
No reason to re-write the whole program again.
It's more useful to learn by doing it this way.


::main.cpp:: (similar to D3DApp)
Instantiate the Editor

::Editor.cpp:: (similar to InitDirect3DApp)
The Editor uses it's own instance of the renderer to draw

::Renderer.cpp:: (similar to D3DApp)
Rendering code (Draw, Update, Resize)

Version 2 ideas:

- Show version 1 to Cherno / Jared and ask for feedback
